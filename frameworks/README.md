# Framework comparison #
Here, each folder represents one framework we used. Each framework contains the code used and the workflow process description. 
The *run_framework_experiments* file runs each experiment 100 times and saves the data to a .csv file.

The official web pages of each framework (that include installation guides) are:
<ul>
  <li> Kopf - https://kopf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</li>
  <li> Metacontroller - https://metacontroller.github.io/metacontroller/intro.html</li>
  <li> Operator SDK - https://sdk.operatorframework.io/</li>
