After you've obtained the assignment code, there are two possible ways to load that code in IntelliJ: either as a whole
project, or as a single module in a project. IntelliJ can only open one project in each window, but each project may have
multiple modules.
We recommend importing our code as separate projects, since our assignments contain duplicated files that sometimes
confuse IntelliJ, however you may choose to use a single project if you wish; see the bottom of the page for instructions.
(Benefits of the single-project workflow include only needing to set our settings for a single project instead of all new
projects, and having the ability to view files from all assignments in the same IntelliJ window.)
